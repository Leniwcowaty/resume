# About me
- description:  I am an enthusiast. I have always loved the world of computers, networks, and liked to pick apart how it all works. This was like unpacking a chocolate bar for me. Since I was a kid, I always knew I would end up in IT, working with big infrastructures. Now this dream came true, and I like to think, I still have this child-like wonder, whenever I learn something new about my job. I like reading news articles and engaging in conversations about the sysadmin world. Personally I use Windows, Linux, MacOS and BSD, and self-host my own services on a homelab server.
